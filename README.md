# Description
Welcome! These are the labs that I made for my Computer Organization course (OC @IST) class in the year academic year 2023/2024.

They were three in total, and their goals are described in the following sections.

## Lab1 - System Modeling and Profiling
- Determining the characteristics of a computer's caches
- Leveraging the obtained knowledge to optimize the performance of a given program

## Lab2 - Cache Simulator
- Development of a complete memory hierarchy with three versions:
  - (4.1) Directly-Mapped L1 Cache with multiple lines
  - (4.2) Directly-Mapped L2 Cache, using the previously defined cache in 4.1
  - (4.3) 2-Way L2 Cache, changing the cache developed in the previous task to perform a two way set-associate cache

## Lab3 - Instruction Level Parallelism
- Provide students with a direct and close contact to the operation of a pipelined computer architecture
- Utilize techniques that are commonly applied in order to maximize the efficiency of the developed computer programs
